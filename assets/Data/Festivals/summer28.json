        "Demetrius": "The 'Moonlight Jelly'... what a remarkable species! We're very lucky that they stop here on their long journey south.#$e#It's unknown why they are attracted to light... very curious.",
        "Maru": "It's kind of cold, actually. I guess fall is right around the corner.",
        "Sebastian": "I thought I saw something moving in there... something big, something dark.#$e#Just trying to scare you...$h",
        "Pierre": "Psst... Make sure to swing by the shop tomorrow to get your fall seeds!",

        "Clint": "I wore my special shoes tonight... No one noticed.$s",
